Title: E2 Mech W/ Seris' Energy Launcher

ALL CREDIT FOR THE ENERGY LAUNCHER GOES TO SERIS!
[E2 Release] Plasma/energy launcher

I have attached 2 energy launchers to the side of my mech and made some modifications to the chip, parenting it to the entity, and making it go by driver eye angles. Other than that, everything is from my old dupe and Seris' Energy Launcher.

Sorry for the lag, my FPS is diminished in SP.

Some things need to be wired up though, ADV Dupe 2 isn't very good at remembering wires. It's all self explanatory though.
