- Title: [Expadv 2] Snakes Game

A blast from the past, nokia colorless snake game!
So, I recently got reminded of the old snake games on the mobile, that I'd spend hour after hour breaking a friends score, and thought, why not bring that experience to garrysmod.

Here we have, a completely client based game made in Expression Advanced, ( Everyone can play at once ) that networks scores and shows them off against other players on the server.

As always, feel free to edit and modify.
