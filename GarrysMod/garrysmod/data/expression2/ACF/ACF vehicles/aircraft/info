Title: [E2] Simple ACF helicopter chip

*[E2] Simple ACF helicopter chip*

Hi!
This is my simple ACF helicopter chip which somewhat accurately simulates helicopter movement.

WIP: Add optional wirelinked rotor & tailrotor entities that can be blown up and disable vertical acceleration and apply angular force.
