Title: acf projectile prediction

tried to explain it as much as i could

predict function doesn't do an arcing trajectory
no idea how to make it
best used for RACs or fast projectile cannons
mortars would work too but if the target goes at a somewhat constant speed
yeah whatever
these won't work on missles
