## Okei's Custom Pathfinder

---------------------------
How does it work ?
---------------------------

Well , it goes straight forward to the target position then it detects the side of the prop that it hits then it avoids it according to what side is closer.

Spawn the E2 Chip , Spawn a Wire - GPS .
Wire Pos from E2 to the Wire - GPS .

Then type #turn on to turn it on or #turn off to turn it off.

Screenies

I was too lazy to make a video, so i made some screenshots.
