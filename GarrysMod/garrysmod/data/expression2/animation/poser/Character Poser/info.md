Title: Character Poser

I made an e2 that you can animate a barney holo with. You can set fps (it will interpolate angles) and scale. I also added a thing that let's you ground it. It will find the lowest hand/foot and move the whole thing down so that it touches the ground.
you can change the model but I made the joints to fit with the barney model as best i could
