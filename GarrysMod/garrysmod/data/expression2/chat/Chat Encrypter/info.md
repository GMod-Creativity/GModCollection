## [E2] Chat Encrypter

Well this is sorta pointless but I made a chat encrpyter.
usage:
/e:[message]
For adv users /key [N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N]
A working key must contain each numbers between 1-20 and also must not have repeating numbers.
Example keys:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
4 3 1 10 5 6 13 7 9 20 19 17 15 18 11 8 12 15 2 14
14 2 5 12 8 11 18 15 17 19 20 9 7 13 6 5 10 1 3 4
2 3 1 5 9 8 4 6 7 10 12 13 11 15 17 14 20 16 19 18 (default key)
18 19 16 20 14 17 15 11 13 12 10 7 6 4 8 9 5 1 3 2
Basically a key is a way to encrypt the text and decrypt.
I currently have no way to decrypt the text so reply away with your own ways!
