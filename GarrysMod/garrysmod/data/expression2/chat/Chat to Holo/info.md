## [E2] Ryno630's Chat to Holo Expression 2

Well have you ever wanted to talk in chat but no one is looking in chat.
Have your Talkative self ever have the need to EXPLAIN THINGS IN ALL CAPS. Then, this is the PERFECT THING FOR YOU.

This is a chat to hologram Expression 2 chip. What is does is it takes what you last said in chat, finds the length and what each index is for all the letters, and creates holograms above your head saying what you typed in chat. I have really wanted to create a E2 like this for a while, but ran into a dilemma from the position of all these holograms sticking off my head. When I got the positions to work I thought I would be nice and release my work to the public to hopefully have as much enjoyment out of this as I have. I intend this Expression 2 to teach and better expand your knowledge on expression 2's language, though I tried many new things and explained some of the things i was doing in this E2, I still am very novice at Expression 2's language and would love it you see flaws, or see a better, faster, less op way of doing things it would be an honor for you to enlighten me in your ways.
