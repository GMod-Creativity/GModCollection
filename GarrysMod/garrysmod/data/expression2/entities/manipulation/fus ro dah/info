"fus ro dah" in chat, regardless of capitalization or inclusion of other phrases, will pick out the closest prop in front of you and propel it forwards, away from you.

To make it easier, I've added three keybinds that does three things. Pressing I automatically says fus ro dah in the chat, pressing O will spawn a predefined prop where you're looking and pressing P will propel a prop without any chat messages.

Don't tell me this can be optimized, there's no need for it. The most you're going to expect from this chip is 20 ops.

Don't tell me this is a minge chip. You can only interact with your own props unless you are an admin. If you want to slam your own prop into others' props, good luck aiming, because it's impossible to do it from a reasonable distance.

Do whatever you want with this chip: copy paste it wherever, claim you made it, print it out, frame it and hang it in your room; I don't care.

TL; DR: this is a useless e2.
