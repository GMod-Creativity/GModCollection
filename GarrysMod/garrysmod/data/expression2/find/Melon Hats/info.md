*Melon Hats E2*
Ahoy, everyone. This E2 finds all of the Watermelons on the map and gives them "Cone Hats". Special thanks to Adult Legs OLeary for helping me get the array working.

To wire it you need two buttons.
One preferably is set to toggle to turn theE2 on.
The second one should not be set to toggle.
The second one is for destroying the melons.
