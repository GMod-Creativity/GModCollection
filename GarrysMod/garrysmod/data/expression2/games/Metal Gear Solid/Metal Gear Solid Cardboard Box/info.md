- Title: [E2] Metal Gear Solid Cardboard Box

Some guy made a Box E2 and it wasn't even the box from Metal Gear Solid.
Shame on him...

I made it myself.

I made the box fall on top of you instead of just appearing now!

To activate it, press your crouch and your zoom key, and it'll toggle on and off.

Extra Requirements: UWSVN with the camera extension enabled.
