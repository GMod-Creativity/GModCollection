- Title: Mandera's Maze Generator

## Mandera's Maze Generator

Hi, I recently saw a bunch of random maze generators and decided to make my own =) The thing that might be unique with mine is that it recycles props when you generate a new maze, allowing for rapid spawning of new random mazes. There's also a race function which lets people race through the maze, from start to finish! (Including anti-cheat and display of players' completion time.)

Commands
"respawn [Width] [Length] [Square count of main path]" will generate a new maze
"respawn" will spawn a maze with the previous configuration
"add [Player's Name]" will add a player to the e2 for racing
"remove [Player's Name]" will remove the player, "remove all" will remove every player
"delete" will delete the spawned maze

I made a video that pretty much sumarizes everything!
(Tried to keep it short ^^)
