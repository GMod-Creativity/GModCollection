Title: [E2] Hologram Entity Copier

*[E2] Hologram Entity Copier*

So this is my second version of this since the last one broke and I never got around to fixing it.

A friend of mine requested an idiot-proof hands-on way to make easy holos for decorative pieces on his vehicles. The UI and chat driven systems are nice but were taking too long for his needs. Basically this chip makes a collection of all the entities parented to it, along with their location, angle, color, and material. It then prints out a full program into a file that can be dropped onto the base prop which recreates the parented props as holos and parents them to the base prop.

Instructions:
Paste this chip onto the base prop of your vehicle. Constraint and parent all parts you want as holos to this chip. Type "/print FILENAME", where "FILENAME" is whatever you want. (Example: "/print Avenger" will save the file to e2shared/Avenger.txt) You can find the new program in the e2shared directory in your expression 2 editor. Paste the new program anywhere on the base plate.

(Instructions are also present in the code)

Sorry for leaving the last one broken for so long. Hopefully this one lasts longer than a few days lol.
