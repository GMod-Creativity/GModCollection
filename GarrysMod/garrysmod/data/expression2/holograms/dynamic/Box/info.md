## [E2] Box

I made this because i wanted i box to build in for some odd reason and thought maybe someone else did to. It does not need any other addon except wiremod to work. The corners are a bit buggy but i don't know how to fix them so if anyone knows please tell me. Also the code i put below runs at 1300 ops with the interval set to 10 but if the server can't handle that for some reason just change it to 100 and it will run at 200 ops.

Known bugs: The box won't go over 50 units out because of a limit with the last update of gmod

To use it just get the adv wire tool and click on pos1 then on cube or a prop and then click pos2 and do the same thing on a different prop.

Update: I sorta fixed the corners and fixed some of the scaling.
Update 2: I fixed the lines getting inverted
