Title: Heisenberg Hat

*Heisenberg Hat*

Hello! I'm new to WireMod, but I'm pretty good at making hats! Here's a good one!

It would be awesome if you wear this hat, and even more awesome if you give me a couple of tips! This was really just a mish-mash of code from a follower, And it looks almost exactly like Walter White's hat from Breaking Bad! HAPPY HATTING!
