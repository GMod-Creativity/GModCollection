Title: Genetic Algorithm Visualizer

*Genetic Algorithm Visualizer*

Something i wrote for a science class in college back in november, which I've been too lazy to post here. Not sure this is necessarily what y'all would find interesting, since it's not a mech, tank, game, plane, etc.

Tl;dr holographic representation of genetic algorithms (algorithms which use the principles of genetic material, to solve real-world problems). GAs are well suited to problems with no "perfect" solution. Neural nets are similar but harder to implement in e2 in most cases, and more of a "find the ratio of fitness" kind of solution.

Since doing this, been considering GAs for actual uses but had no real solid ideas yet. Since doing this I finally got a non-upshifted mic, my voice sounds weird as fuck doing this.
