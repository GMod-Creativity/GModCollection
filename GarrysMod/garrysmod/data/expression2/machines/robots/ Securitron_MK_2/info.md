Title: Securitron MK 2

*Securitron MK 2*

This is my securitron I spent about a day polishing to perfection. It's a little hard to set up the first time, so feel free to skip to the tutorial, or just watch it all the way through. I sped it up, so feel free to pause whenever you need to. 
Most of it is reasonably self explanitory, but you may want to check out the video once or twice to make sure your assumptions are correct.

This project was pretty fun throughout, but really became a headache during the manager section and trying to get all of that to work properly. I eventually scrapped a more advanced and powerful manager in order to save my shreds of sanity I still had left over. So, I now present, my (almost) finished, Securitron MK 2!

No, I will not make it drive backwards.

I hope you have more fun using this than I did making it. :P

Edit: I've made various changes to the code since original publishing, so you may have an older, more overpowered version and may need to upgrade.
