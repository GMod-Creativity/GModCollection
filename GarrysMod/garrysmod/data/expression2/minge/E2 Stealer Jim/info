Title: E2 Stealer Fix/Update

*E2 Stealer Fix/Update*

I added a few new features.
Return
Hide/Show
TP


The return function takes the information received when you use the /find function and allows you to return a chip with its position and angles.

The hide/show just makes it so the chip is set to notSolid. This doesn't hide the hologram but it does make the chip impossible to copy/move/see.

The TP function just takes the propmanipulate function and only uses the position parameter. Added this if someone wanted to easily move the found object.
