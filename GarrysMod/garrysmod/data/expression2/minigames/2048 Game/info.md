- Title: [E2] 2048 Game

## [E2] 2048 Game

It's my first work which I upload on Wiremod.com
Code was written in about 2 days

Note:
SG White Panda:
After playing around some more, I figured how to make it work.

Spawn E2
Spawn Big Office Chair (from vehicles)
Spawn in EGP v3 Screen
Spawn Adv Pod Cont on the chair
Link Adv Pod Cont to the chair
Wire the E2 to the [EGP WireLink]
Wire E2 to the [Pod WireLink]
Update the E2 chip.

Only problem is is I can't seem to move any of the tiles.
