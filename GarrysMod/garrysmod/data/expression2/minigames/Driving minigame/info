Title: [E2] Driving minigame!

*[E2] Driving minigame!*

Here's probably the most complex E2 contraption I ever made. It's basically a mini-game where you have to drive a "car" and avoid bumping into walls.

Note: I know the code looks weird, that I chose to store each possible line in an array, instead of calculating it later on, because it would have made a tick quota exceeded error. Also I didn't really know how to use the explode() function to convert strings to arrays until I finished it, but whatever since it works.

Wire Space/A/D/Active to their respective places in pod controller
Driver to the chair
Main 8x8 screen String to String
Scoreboard 4x4 screen String to Screen2Text
Pod controller Eject to Kick

NOTE: Make sure your screen uses text size of 5 and Courier New font
