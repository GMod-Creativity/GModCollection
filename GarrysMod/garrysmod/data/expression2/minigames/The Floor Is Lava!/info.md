- Title: [E2] The Floor Is Lava!

## [E2] The Floor Is Lava!

The floor is lava!

This E2 is for making obstacle courses that kill people when they fail! (Requires you to be admin/mod and have the ability to slay people)

Build a track, spawn the E2, look at the starting prop and type ".start", then look and the last prop and type ".goal".
Then make people stand on the start prop and type ".tfil"

You have to have admin privileges for the people to die when they fail.

**You have to manually change the commands and names in the E2.**
**Requires concmd!**

To start it, build your course, spawn the E2, look at the start prop and type ".start" then look at the goal prop and type ".goal".

Any feedback would be appreciated!
