Title: [E2] Hologram Crowbar Replacement

## [E2] Hologram Crowbar Replacement

One of my oldest Expression 2 codes I've made. Probably very poorly optimized as I was, and still am, horrid at this.
Type in the given words to change the crowbar to whatever you typed.

Any input as to how I can better this, or the way I wrote this, would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks to Chaquator for the input on using a switch.
