- Title: [E2] Player Tracking Chip(not as cool as it sounds...)

I got bored a few days ago, and decided to make something based on one prop. It was an arrow prop from the SProps addon, it just looked too cool not to be used. Anyway, this chip points to every player on the map, the arrows are also colored based on the players team color. The chip seems to be very unoptimized and coded a bit weird to me anyway, I usually code things very neatly. But here it is, if you want to edit it or try to optimized it for me, go right ahead, but I'm not requesting anything just releasing it. Have fun guys!

By the way, 12.000005722046 is 1 holo unit. That's why I did Ent:boxSize():z()/12.000005722046. So it would convert it to source units instead of using holo units.
