Title: 3D Printing Device

*3D Printing Device*

For those who have OCD and just can't get a build looking nice, here is a potential solution to your problem. This E2 allows you to print a 10x10x10 cube of props extremely precisely, without even having to touch your physics gun.

Here's the code for those who want to experiment with it, or just need small precisely made parts in a pinch.

After you have printed it, your creation will be welded to the base plate that the printer spawned. If using this to print parts for a build, Smart-Welding it is a good idea. Just don't set max welds per prop too high or you will be waiting for a very, very long time..

As always, use responsibly and have fun!
