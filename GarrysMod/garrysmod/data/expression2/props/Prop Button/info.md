Title: [E2]Prop Button

*[E2]Prop Button*

Just two e2's I made that let you activate something by looking at a selected prop and pressing e (use button).
Two versions, one that is toggle and one that is not. I tried to incorporate the two together but for some reason it wouldn't work. I dunno, either way they work great. Just wire "Button" entity to selected prop. And set how far away you want the button to work from in "DetectionRange".

I made these for a sliding door on a project I was working on.
