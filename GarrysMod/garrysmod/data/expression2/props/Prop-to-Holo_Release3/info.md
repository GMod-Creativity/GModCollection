Title: [E2] Prop-to-Holo | Release 3!

*[E2] Prop-to-Holo | Release 3!*

ZeroG sent me a PM a week or two back that inspired me to do better in my chips that I release..

This guy deserves a lot of props for that.

Anyways, I was inspired to remake my prop-to-holo chip once again. This time around, I optimized it in terms of e2 performance (in the e2 itself, not purposely, if at all, in the export) and readability (in both the e2 and export, so you can add extra props after the fact). The instructions are simple: Take your grav gun out, select your base prop and props you want to export, type "-save <name>", and use that export to your liking. If you need more help, go ahead and ask, since I'm too conceited to see a problem, and I'm putting this statement here to counter it.

I made a video showing off how I could do it in a snap. In real time, it took me like 7-9 minutes in total.

Now that inverse-kinematics function isn't entirely mine. Artik had given me the little bit and I turned it into a function for him. I was gonna exclude it, which is why you see #include "lib/functions" in the video, but I got over that because you can find it on the forums with some searching.
I feel like a bitch for making this post, Artik. Sorry bout that.

Update: Added scale and area selection
