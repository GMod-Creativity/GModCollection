*[BETA] GTMP v1.0 -- Practical Topographical maps*

Pretty much the title and the vid. This is a simple system that creates your average herapderp raycaster maps. A side project for when I was burned out on MPFC.

Big difference from generic raycaster maps is that this saves maps for future use. It attempts to load a file it would have written when you were on the map before. So if I spawn it once in singleplayer or multiplayer, it will scan the world, save the topographic data in vON encoding, and draw it to the screen. A week later I play the same map in multiplayer, spawn the same e2, it'll look, find the file, open it, and render--no laggy world-scanning, just a quick file decoding and draw.

Currently all features except the map/world localization is done (it outputs derped Z coords in world and it needs reset to track world coords as shown in the video if the GPS isn't wired up, fuck if I know why). Still it's certainly perfectly usable as is, and it'll get fixed in the next day or two. Might as well put it up now and see what people think.
