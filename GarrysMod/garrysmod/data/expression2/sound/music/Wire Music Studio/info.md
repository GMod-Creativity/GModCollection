## Wire Music Studio

This is a project that started as a simple holopiano and then slowly evolved into something awesomely fun. It's essentially a minimalistic remake of FL Studio's piano roll with EGP. The video explains it best:

Interaction is pretty easy, left click to place a note in the edit area, play a key, or select an option. Right click to remove a placed note. E will move the playbar to the specified area. Chat commands are done for more complicated functions:
!load will load the specified file, eg: "!load aerodynamic"
!save will save the current song with the specified filename, eg: "!save mortal kombat"
!clear will clear the entire song, a dialog will pop up to confirm.
!bpm will change the beats (4 notes blocks) per minute, eg "!bpm 130"
!page or !p will jump to the specified page, eg "!page 10", "!p 10"
For multi-link you wire the desired master E2 e2link to the desired slave E2 e2ent.

Thanks to Zoombahh for coding the multi-screen synchronisation, it's great for more complicated songs, omicron for helping out with some of the interface code and MoPaZoDoZ for the awesome intro in the video. Thanks to the above and the following for bug testing and writing music for WM Studio: Wenli, Divran, Rasa, Volvox

Here's the dupe:
guiletheme.txt

I've also included a several songs. These needs to go in the data/e2files/WMStudio1 folder.
tetris.txt
ravers.txt
aerodynamic.txt
wm studio v1.txt

This contains both the dupe and my entire collection of music:

And have fun.
