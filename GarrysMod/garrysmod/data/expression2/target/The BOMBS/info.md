## Explosives Are fun aren't they

New edits will come out after I clean this messy coding up, however here you are have fun with this The airstrike function is a WIP as is the guided missile however: pointing and sswinging a crowbar at a car (scar sgm sligwolfs whatever doesn't matter anything with Hl2 seats in it) or a player will decimate the player or car with explosives, the m9k hk45 pistol has explosive rounds, and the m9k deagle will shoot missiles from it's self (rainbow trails ^_^)

This e2 was coded on the shadyservers.org sandbox server, feel free to come and see what madness we're up to!
