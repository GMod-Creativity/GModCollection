Title: Dimension Door E2

*Dimension Door*

Welcome, new Aethernauts! Here a most important tool in the young Cadet's toolbelt! I present to you, the Dimension Door.

Setting up the Dimension Door is as easy as Clockwork Technician School, if you know what you're doing! Simply place the Ethereal Translocation Over World (ETWO, for short) on any Prison Pod (available in the SteamPunker's gift store for as low as 250â‚§), and you'll be on your way to traversing walls and floors!

To use, simply press your General Device Button on any surface, and removal can be done in the same fashion, only less limited to surface placement. Remember, constructing a door requires proximity! My students always forget that.

Happy Translocating!

(Out Of Character)
Well, if you didn't get it from my fun "steampunky" description, this is a door that goes through walls. Fun for entering places, or just dicking around and getting in places you shouldn't be.
After being pasted on a prisoner pod, all you have to do is press G on any surface to place a door through the wall. It *Does* have a max range, but you generally won't run into that unless you place it on the edge of the world.
Note that you must press your use key on the open door to go through, and sometimes you have to do it in different places. It's a little bit fiddly. Anyway, have fun!
