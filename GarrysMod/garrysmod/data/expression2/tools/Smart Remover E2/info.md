- Title: Smart Remover E2

## Smart Remover

Got pissed off that some servers don't have the Smart Remover tool, so I whipped up this mofo to do my removing.

Pastebin link (easier to grab than C&P):

I have the selection weapon set to the crowbar, but that can be changed to gravity gun by replacing "weapon_crowbar" with "weapon_physcannon" (correct me if I'm wrong, I just guessed that). Right click to select those props that must have done some devilish deed to you. After you selected your victim props, send them straight to hell with the Use key.

Enjoy!

Used some of the entity selection code from redreaper's Build Bucket in this, I was stumped at the time.
