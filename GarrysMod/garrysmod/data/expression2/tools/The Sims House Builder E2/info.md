- Title: Playzr's Housebuild E2 V.1.1 for Garry's Mod
- Updated: Apr 4th, 2019

An E2 I made in Garry's Mod that lets you build houses like in the popular game The Sims. It uses Expression Gate 2 and PropCore functions.

6 years later, here's the 'fixed' E2 code: [https://pastebin.com/UKuHeyyc](https://pastebin.com/UKuHeyyc)
It's the same code just with the glonEncode and glonDecode changed to vonEncode and vonDecode. As for missing textures, this still works fine for me when I test it on a multiplayer server. I'm delighted some people still think this old E2 is pretty cool.
