- Title: Chaqua VTOL E2

Saw some people flying on a server, felt bad since my recent flying E2s were too complex to be enjoyable, so I made this one.

It's easy to use.

All you do is spawn your base prop, parent (or even weld) your chair to the base, and spawn the E2 on it.

It's as simple as that.

The controls are:
W & S - Control Pitch
A & D - Control Roll
M1 & M2 - Control Yaw
Shift & Space - Control Throttle

EXTRA INFO:
User: Great work but you might have to fixur code it keeps on going up for me ?
Change FC to something lower than 9. This number is different for lots of servers.

**IronManhood edit:**
IronManhood: Hey, I took out mouse control. Check it out and let me know what you think.

Chaquator: So you made pressing A and D change the yaw as well as the roll? Nicely done, but I prefer having full control of all 3 axis of rotation separately.
