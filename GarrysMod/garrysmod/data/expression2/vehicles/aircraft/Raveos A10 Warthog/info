Title: [E2] Raveos A10 Warthog

*[E2] Raveos A10 Warthog*

Hello, friends. I made this yesterday and thought I would share it. Its modelled on the A10 Warthog, uses my Iron Dome weapons system and my Flight Mk3 movement. It supports ACF weapons and I HIGHLY recommend using them.

Requires: PropCore.
Optional: ACF, Sprops.
