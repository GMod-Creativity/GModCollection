Description:
This long legged spider chair allows anybody to climb walls, wherever you want!

The E2 I got it from was from this link:

I fixed it and made it work on any server!
have fun!

(This needs wiremod to work!)

Secret: if you change the material on the invisible box under the chair, the legs will change to that material!
