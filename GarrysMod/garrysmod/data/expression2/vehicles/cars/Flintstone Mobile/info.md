*Flintstone Mobile*

So I was using some skills learned from shooting bombs, applyForce. When I found some code to register individual keys but it outputted if any key was pressed, I thought of this idea. Then I added code to turn a prop locally based on the bearing of a vehicle. Then I had a bunch of sounds output differing pitches. Then I made a light indicator which ran in parallel with the sounds taking up computation time as well as something to toggle button prints. Also, a steering wheel was made by using an elastic and using applyForce to a wheel.
