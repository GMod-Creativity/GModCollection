## Raveos Instant Hover Car

I try and make my chips as easy to use as possible. Here are some simple steps to use:

1: Spawn a prop in to place the E2 onto (1x1 plate works best)

2: Spawn the E2 on top of the prop.

3: Place a chair down anywhere on the prop (once the chip detects a chair nearby it will automatically link it)

4: Enjoy!

Edit 1: Added trails
Edit 2: No longer will get stuck on walls, now it will either stop or explode.
