## [E2] Raveos Instant Stunt Car!

Hello everyone. This is my instant stunt car. No wiring is required. simply copy the E2 and put it on any chair! Very easy.

First of all I would like to apologise for the crappy looking car. I'm not very creative or good when it comes to modelling holograms. To make up for this somewhat I've made this car as customisable as possible. Almost anything pertaining to the physics or aesthetics can be changed easily, you can even disable the holograms and then build your own body. Just remember to set all the weights to 0 and parent them to the chair!!!!!!!

Secondly, I ask that you simply take a moment to read the small messages that pops up in the bottom right hand corner when you get into your car. They will tell you the controls! Too many people use my stuff then ask what the controls are.

Thirdly, I am open to suggestions and ideas. I would appreciate it if you informed me about any bugs so I can get around to fixing them. Currently on my "to do" list is

1: Fix a small physics bug when landing on the tail end. (done)

2: Improve car look.

3: Add a holographic speedo

4: Add gear sounds.

I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Please leave a "like" if you like it. Thank you. Have fun!

23/01/2014: Updated version 1.1. Fixed random bouncing and tightened up most applyForce code. Added Reverse gear.
