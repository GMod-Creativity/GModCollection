This is my HK-Drone V2. The E2 code is very out of date and it probably will not work correctly for you. You are welcome to experiment and modify the E2 chip and fix it if you can. The main E2 chip is invisible and located on the belly just behind the turrets. The missile E2 chips are invisible and located on the back of each missile pod.

Unfortunately I don't play Gmod any more. I've prioritized other games and other areas of my life. This means I won't be making any tutorials or making any new releases.
