- Title: Dynamech

## Dynamech

Basically, this is an applyForce/applyTorque mech which introduces a few new ideas to make the movement amazingly smooth and precise without the odd odd walking or sliding I've seen in other applyForce mechs and my own earlier attempts. It uses dynamically generated B?zier curves to ensure smooth paths of any size or distance. This results in very realistic movement (Notice when I grab a leg and tug on it it hobbles and hops to counter-balance) while minimising parts (No hydraulics, elastics etc) and maintains the speed and precision we're used to for E2 mechs. It can run (both feet are off the ground when it's running), but it can be buggy, you can see it running in the sewers.

Code & Dupe tomorrow

Any questions?

E2 code and Dupe below. Controls are W A S D for forwards, backwards and strafing. Shift and R to turn left and right (Soon to be mouse controlled). Hold space to run (Glitchy).
