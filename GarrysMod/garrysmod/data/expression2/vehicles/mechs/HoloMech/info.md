Thanks to Omicron for helping me pick materials!
and to many others from Drunkie's server and the [W.I.R.E] server who motivated/inspired me and helped me along the way.

Ktccd's Edited version:
Lol XD.
KK, this is really very simple, I planned on more fixes, but flieboy caught me in his holo-creations trap, and now I gotta make some too XD.

How to set up:
Not much different, spawn a wire gun, wire fire to the output, press E when watching it and it should go invisible and noclip itself this time XD. (noclip it yourself if you don't have propcore. Code does not require propcore to work though.)
