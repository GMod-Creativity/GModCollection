- Title: [E2] Fully Customizable User Friendly SetAng Steering Chip for Land Vehicles.

Disclaimer: This chip was NOT originally created by me. I only take 10% of the credit for this chip. I simply cleaned it up and made it more user friendly. I personally do not know the original creator of the chip, so if you are the original creator I will happily remove this if you would so prefer.

Now for the actual chip. This chip uses the SetAng function to make a simple and reliable steering process to use on any vehicle you would like. It has been created for wheels, but I see no problem with using it for boats or planes or whatever else. Anyways, it's not the most realistic, and it's not perfect, but it's easy to use and to keep using. Simply change the values inside of the chip to change the steering characteristics. I have included instructions inside the chip as well, so you don't need to fret if you don't know how to use it.

This is the code for it. I will include a download if you are so inclined. Just tell me.

Here, have a steering.

############### - FAQ - ###############

"My car isn't moving, it only steers!"

- This is because the chip does not include propulsion. It simply is a steering chip.

"When I connect the 'Base' input to my base prop, the chip flips sideways and won't turn the right way!"

- I have not found an internal fix for this, but you can either flip your prop the right way up or you can weld a prop on/inside of the main one and connect that instead of the base. This does not affect the steering in any way.

"When I dupe the chip, the wheels are facing the wrong way!"

- Sometimes when a dupe is completed the Base input unwires itself. This may have been fixed, but I don't yet know. You can either wire it up again, or you can spawn an entity marker, link it to the base, and wire the chip to the entity marker instead. This should keep it wired through dupes.

"I'm trying to put a value like .5 into the chip, but an error pops up that says ''.' is not a supported character!'"

- E2 doesn't like values with the point first, so use 0.5 instead.

That should be all. Any questions are welcome and I would appreciate it if you would share some of your builds with me!

Thanks,

Edit - Eek, forgot a big issue. Remember to ALWAYS have your contraption facing north-south, otherwise the ballsockets will glitch out! You can find the north-south direction by spraying your spray on the ground. The side of the spray facing upwards will be the north-south direction.
