Title: Mini holo Scorpion tank

*Mini holo Scorpion tank*

I had a sudden urge to make a tank and decided to make a miniature hologram tank. even shoots hologram bullets that explode! it can go up inclines both world and prop made. it doesnt match the angle of the surface its on, couldnt figure out how to make it do that without it spazzing out.

instructions for use:
1. spawn a chair
2. spawn pod controler and link to chair
3. spawn cam controler and link to chair
4. wire the e2's wirelinks to their respective controlers
5. type !r to reset the e2
6. ???
7. profit!


let me know what you think or if you have any ideas to improve the e2 or if you have an idea for an e2 youd like me to try and make for you.

just put in your
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\d ata\expression2 folder
