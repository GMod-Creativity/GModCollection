- Title: [RELEASE] Red's Track Chip V6 - Slack tracks and snow cats, oh my!

Not gonna bother with an intro since people who use this know exactly how it works.
V6 adds support for only the left track (so you can do a single track, like a snowmobile) as a built in feature, and adds slack tracks. It now supports about 40 wheels on each side (do you really need that many?), assuming it doesn't break from ops. The entire code was rewritten from the ground up.
Here's a vid of an older recon tank of mine with them. The newer version will be smoother running and also has support for slack tracks, like on tanks such as the panther and christie tanks.

Updates:
Mr white has added rotated track textures to WTP, to work with this. In addition he pointed out to me a way of optimizing it, and I found a piece of code left over that was supposed to be kaput. So now slack tracks will run a good bit smoother.

Updated code with a smoother slack-track system that reuses some computations and removed an accidentally copied over holoCreate.
