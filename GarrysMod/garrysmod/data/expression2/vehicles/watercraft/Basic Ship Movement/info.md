Title: Basic Ship Movement E2 [Propulsion & Self Buoyancy]

*Basic Ship Movement E2 [Propulsion & Self Buoyancy]*

Hey there,
So a couple of weeks back, I released an acf cruiser dupe, which included my crappy old basic ship movement e2. Some people took to using it for their own ships. The main problem with the old chip, was that it caused shaking at higher speeds, because of the physics produced by the buoyancy tool in gmod / set buoyancy already found on the prop. Anyways, I decided to upgrade the e2 with its own buoyancy, therefore making higher speeds possible, with no shaking at all. I also had to create water resistance, as this was something also created with the buoyancy tool.

This chip is pretty easy to use on anything. It is recommended that you setup the base with the chip and test it all out before making an exterior, just in the case that you set the base up the incorrectly.

IMPORTANT: When setting up on the base, there are two things that are paramount.
1: Use P.A or some similar tool to get the angles of the base, make sure pitch is at 0 while you are building your exterior, otherwise the base could flip to the opposite side.
EDIT: Shadow showed me there was a propSetBuoyancy() function, this makes the chip even easier to set up.

Features:

-Settings for max speed, accel and turning speed. Makes for good use on any type of ship. I've seen it used on speed boats, warships and oil tankers of sorts.

-Engine sound, tis relative to the speed over maxspeed. So don't worry about changing it.

-Auto throttle. So it will pretty much keep throttling up until you reach your max speed. It's not a percentage e.g. (0-100) throttle.

-Simple ass controls. W, S, A, D.

-Simulated buoyancy and water resistance. This was required to replace the buoyancy tool.

Hope your ships go well when using this chip. Chuck some screenshots in the comments if all went well, all the best,
Enyx.
