## [E2 Release] Energy Shield V2

so more than a year ago i made an E2 that regenerates your health and armor as long as you have more than 1 armor, but it was a little overpowered. so now after messing around with it for fun several months later, ive balanced it a lot more and i believe it is finally ready for release.

Requirements:

- EP2
- EP1
- Portal 2
- TF2
- AutoTitan soundpack that you can get here: [www.serisism.tk/download/misc/autotitan.rar](www.serisism.tk/download/misc/autotitan.rar)

How to Use:

- paste the dupe and then upload the E2 to the chip
