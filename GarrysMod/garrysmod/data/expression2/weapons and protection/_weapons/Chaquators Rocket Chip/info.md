## Chaquator's Rocket Chip

Since I see alot of people needing rockets for a special 'umph' on their contraptions, I wrote this simple code. It took me about 3-5 minutes to make.
If you want an actual REALISTIC chip, don't choose mine. It barely took effort to make this and probably will be bad.

Enjoy.
