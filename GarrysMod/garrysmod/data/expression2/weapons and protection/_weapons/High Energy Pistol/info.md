## [E2] High Energy Pistol

This is the part where I learned how to make a SWEP in Lua.
You hold down your secondary attack button and click the use key to change modes. To add a prop, hold down right mouse button then press the walk key. To remove a prop hold down right mouse button then duck. Added props will be available as a mode.
