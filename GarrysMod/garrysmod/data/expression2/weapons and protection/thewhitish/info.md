## [E2] Bounding mine deployer, personal energy shield, orbital bombardment, pocket sand

All of these chips have a single button input, which is coded into the chip and can be changed or disabled (see the Key variable at the top of each chip). They also have one input that is designed to be wired to a momentary numpad input (not toggle) or pod controller, which can replace the internal button.

=====================Bounding Mine Deployer==============

Drop up to 44 bounding mines (like bouncing betty), all controlled with a single E2. Has three modes, flash-bang (blinds target, only triggered by players), anti-personnel (explosive triggered by npc, players, vehicles), and anti-vehicle (only triggered by vehicles, large). Mines jump to height of target, and will explode if tampered with by enemy.

Extremely simple chatless interface that uses only one button (default H), but controls many functions of chip, including displaying stats, switching modes, undo mine drops, and purging all mines.

Features thought out performance control, that limits functions of the chip as the ops limit is approached, and will purge mines to maintain control before the real hard limit is reached.

Extremely customizable and modular; options at the top.

====================Personal Energy Shield==============
Spawn a big heavy transparent prop around you to block mingeing, or the vengeful bullets of the minged.

Toggle-able with a button (default G). Hovers at a height that balances mobility with protection. If crouched, the shield drops to the floor, and a second inner shield deploys to protect from bullets with penetration.

If the angle of the prop becomes too extreme, or its position from you becomes too displaced, it will immediately disappear to prevent it's 50,000 kilograms from crushing you. Works most of the time.

====================Orbital Bombardment================

Rain explosive props from the sky, with some pretty neat visuals and audio. Highly customizable, with adjustable radius, salvo size, and rate.

The button (default M) has to be held down for a short time. Tapping might not always work.

========================Pocket Sand===================
Just like the flash bang, but skipping the delivery system. This version has a slow fade effect. Just look at the target and press B.
