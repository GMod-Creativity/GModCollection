Title: Kirito's Sword - Holo Sword

*Kirito's Sword - Holo Sword*

I made this within like an hour, I loved the reactions I got in-game, everyone was asking how I got it. I got a bit lazy on the handle, as you may see, but it is still recognizable. I plan to make the sword attach to the back of the player when not equipped.

Change the "<weapon name here>" to the weapon you will be using.
