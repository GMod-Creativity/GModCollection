Title: Prop Sniper

*Prop Sniper*

I got board and instead of trying to make a prop body to Acf guns, I made a prop sniper rifle. It has a holo trigger and a working firing mechanism. Takes a 500lb shell from the Propeller pack.
Here's it in action:

I may release the firing e2, but not the trigger.
If and when that happens, I'd like to see different sniper rifle designs.
