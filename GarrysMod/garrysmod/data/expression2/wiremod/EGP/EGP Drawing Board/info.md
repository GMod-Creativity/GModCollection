- Title: [E2] - Expression 2 EGP Drawing Board

## [E2] - Expression 2 EGP Drawing Board

A simple drawing board make in Expression 2 & EGP. Been sorta bored lately so I'm just making random things. I probably won't finish this cause I never finish anything, so I thought I would release it to someone who could use it.

How to use:

1. Wirelink the chip to an EGP Screen.
2. The Use key creates a pixel on screen.
3. Middle Mouse key creates a triangle. ( 3 steps, press it three times to set the three points of the triangle )
4. Right Mouse click and drag to create a line.
5. "!clear.all" clears all objects on screen.
6. "!clear.pixels/lines/triangles" clears the respected objects on screen.
7. "!size.size" changes the pixel size and grid snap. ( somewhat broken, I would only use powers of 2 for this and no higher than 128 )
8. "!col.red.green.blue" changes the color of all new objects. ( resets after using !clear ) - Example: "!col.255.0.0" would be red

You can make some pretty cool things with this, and it's just fun to mess around with. If I ever do work on this again I might add in a code generator that makes the EGP code for other chips based on what you made. Seems like it could be useful for a quite a few things. Anyway, enjoy guys, and give some feedback on what you think/like/dislike.
