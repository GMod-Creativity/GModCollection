## [E2] Teleporter EGP Console

Hello,

This is my first time posting on the Wiremod Forums so....Hi.

I've been working with wiremod for the past two weeks or so. I started learning using the Gates but soon learned about the expression 2 side of Wiremod so I gave it a try. I recently learned to use EGP to make touchscreen monitors and made this after a while

The Teleport TouchScreen Monitor:

I got this idea from watching a youtube video of a spacebuild creation where the guy had tons of console such as these for weapons and Life Support and such. I Did not directly copy any of his code instead created my own TouchScreen Teleporter using the same Techniques.

Wiring
Inputs: EGP -> EGP Screen,User -> EGP Screen
Outputs: Jump <- Teleporter(Jump),JumpPos <- Teleporter(TargetPos)
