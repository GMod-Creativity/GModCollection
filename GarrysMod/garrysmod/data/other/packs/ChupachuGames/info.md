Here's every E2 I've ever made, found, or experimented with: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2frjtqqz1cvbraj/E2s.zip?dl=0

This pack includes my Hovercar scripts, Securitrons (Old and New, check out SecuritronBody for the new one) and a DecoyPlayer which lets you create a fake holo of yourself by pressing ALT.

There's also:

NewMortar_AimPos: a mortar where you point somewhere with the crowbar and it fires a mortar in a parabola towards it

NewMortar Defender: does same thing but an attempt at auto-targeting within a given radius around the E2

TestHumanPlayer and TestZombie: Zombie/Human holos that can kill each other, where you pilot the human

StealthBot: same as securitron but is a metrocop that shoots nearest target who has a weapon (cannot be killed yet)

Securitron MK2 Nerf Nolight: the actual securitron E2 used in the video above, can be partnered with Securitron Manager to be remote controlled (up to 3 securitrons at once)

PropSpawn_Shield_SAFE: spawns a shield around the player when crouched, then removes itself once stood

Hoverboard Noshield: hold space to jetpack around until you run out of fuel, then it recharges. Can be linked with an EGP for a fuel bar or can use audio ques/hints

Grenade Mover Aimpos: uses SetPos on grenades to fly them at your crosshair, can be used to instantly send grenades at players and kill them. There's also a variant that sends them to players automatically, but you need to wire it up with the TargetGiver chip

TargetGiver: a chip designated to doing a FindClosest player to your crosshair, used to wire to other chips that also use the Find functions

BlockEater: basic EGP game where similar to agar.io but with worse logic

Mechsuit: my latest build (incomplete), but it's very fun to drive around shooting the guns and having new arms and armor airdropped in when destroyed

Mounted Laser: fixes gun to car and uses eyes and left click to operate

Sonar: creates a holo scan in a 360 radius, doesn't help for anything but looks neat
