Hello, i'm HerrKitz.

You did download the whole collection of all things i've ever complitted within 2300 hours of playtime and span of more then 5 years. 
Not all of them have same quality (literally non at all) and controlls might be wierd.

English is not mine native language so there WILL be mistakes.

There is a .docx file in every category and subcategory with description and manual for every entity in that category.

You are free to share this archive and any finished things with anyone anywhere anytime.

All dupes devided in 2 major categories - ACF based and Non ACF (usually just wiremod)
You can download all ACF-addons following those links:
https://github.com/nrlulz/ACF
https://github.com/bouletmarc/ACF_CustomMod
https://github.com/Bubbus/ACF-Missiles

IT IS HIGHLY ADVICED NOT TO ROTATE WITH ADVDUPE2 ANY NON-ACF VEHICLES!
