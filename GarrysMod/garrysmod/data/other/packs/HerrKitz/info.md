Big AdvDupe2 dupes archive
After long and fun 6 years of playing GMod, I feel reall tired from it and want to stop playing. I wanted to share all working things via workshop, but vanilla duplicator don't like parenting, so i uploaded it to Google Drive.

In the archive over 90 dupes, divided between ACF+SProps+Wire based and Vanilla+Wire based dupes. There're ground vehicles, flying thing and statics like bases in each category.

There is a README file and the archive and .docx files in each subcategory, explaining how things work. If you have any questions about controlls and what does that thing do - refer to description files in their subcategoty.

If something is REALLY broken - comment here, will try to help you

P.S. English is not mine native language, so if you see mistakes - deal with it.
