    Before you can start running around and lighting things on fire, you need to set up your dragon. The default config gives you a pretty bland dragon
    named Grayscale (Get it? Because he's gray, and has scales?). While he is an affable ambassador between the two species, he's probably not what
    you're envisioning as your ideal dragon companion.
    
    First, open the E2 editor. Create a folder in your main Expression 2 folder called "dragonscript", and make a folder inside that called "settings".
    Then, press the [UPDATE] button on the E2 browser.
    
    Then open the three E2s on the inside of the dragon's complementary code crate. They are "dragonscript/hologen.txt", "dragonscript/animations.txt",
    and "dragonscript/settings/grayscale.txt". In each one, press [SAVE AS] and save as the default names. Once you're done with all three, press [UPDATE] again!
    
    Then, navigate to the folder dragonscript/settings, and open up "grayscale.txt".
    Pick a name for your dragon. Right on line 1, change "@name dragonscript/settings/grayscale" to "@name dragonscript/settings/<dragon name here>".
    Avoid using any special characters like periods, commas, dollar signs, etc. Underscores ( _ ) and spaces are Okay.
    
    Click [SAVE AS] and save your new dragon config using whatever E2 puts in the box (This is why you changed the @name line!).
    
    Note: make sure you use [SAVE AS] and not [SAVE AND EXIT!]
    
    Now that the overhead is taken care of, we can get to the good stuff! Most of the config variables are pretty self-explanatory, but you can find
    descriptions for everything as follows:
    
    Name: The dragon's name. You can use special characters, but a dragon with the @ sign in its name is going to get laughed at by its classmates.
    Sex: Stifle your giggle. This parameter determines whether a dragon is Male or Female. 0 for Male, 1 for Female.
    ColorBody: The color of the dragon's body, formatted as a vector.
    ColorWings: The color of the dragon's wings, also formatted as a vector.
    ColorEye: Sets the color of the dragon's eyes. You should probably leave this as black.
    Material: The dragon's skin texture. It's fine to leave this as "sprops/textures/sprops_metal5", but you can change it as desired.
    
    Cosmetics:
    Ever wanted to give your dragon a hat? Or a gun holster? Or maybe a Voodoo necklace and hot pink sunglasses? You can do all these and more!
    The config file comes with a very in-depth tutorial on how to add cosmetics, and for the sake of ease of use, it will not be relocated here.
    
    Randomization:
    Randomization works fine in the dragon config files! Say you wanted to make a randomized dragon employee for your company.
    "Sex = random() > 0.5" gives a 50/50 probability of making the dragon male or female.
    "ColorBody = randvec(0,100)" randomizes the dragon's body color. Darker tones (Limiting it to 100 instead of 255) Generally look better.
    The same also works with ColorWings!
    
    Once you're done making the configuration file, save it (Ctrl+S) and press [Update] on the E2 editor's file browser.
    
    Now, open the main E2 (dragonscript/Magnums_Dragon_2.txt) and find Line 43.
    Go ahead and replace the file there with the config file for the dragon you want (Do not include the .txt)!
    For example, replace #include "dragonscript/settings/grayscale" with #include "dragonscript/settings/<dragon name here>" !
    
    Now, spawn the dragon dupe and upload the Main E2 into the dragon's body (The 075x075 PHX Block where the dragon stands).
    
    Your dragon should now be standing in front of you, ready to take on the world!
    
    Custom Code per Config (for advanced users only):
    In the "customCodeConfig" function, you can have any code you like in here. It will run for every single execution of the chip.
    
    Adjusting the config:
    Say you want to make a minor edit, like you're trying to get the color just right or position a hat on the dragon's head.
    Simply make the changes to the config file, SAVE, then manually reupload the Main E2 into the dragon's body.
    If adjusting the cosmetics, check out the cosmetic tool! "dragonscript/cosmetic_tool_2.txt"

    So now that you've got your dragon, what can you do with it?
    
    The most basic application of a dragon is mobility. The dragon is faster than a speeding bullet (1), more powerful than a locomotive (2), and able to
    leap tall builings in a single bound (3)!
    
    (1) Bullet max speed must be no greater than 72.7 Miles Per Hour.
    (2) Setpos is more powerful than any known Applyforce, Thruster, or ACF locomotive.
    (3) Flying counts as a single bound as long as the dragon's feet don't touch the ground.
    
    The dragon is capable of six movement modes. These include:
    
    *Walking/Standing
    *Running
    *Freefall
    *Flight
    *Sliding
    *Swimming
    
    WALKING/STANDING
    
    When you first climb onto the dragon's back (There are two invisible seats on the dragon's back; the front one is for the driver), the dragon will be at a
    standstill. Use [W] and [S] to walk forward or backward, and use [A] and [D] to turn left and right.
    
    Pressing [V] while standing or walking will toggle the dragon's crouch. This makes it easier for the dragon to climb onto props.
    
    Pressing [Shift] while the dragon is walking forward will cause it to break into a run.
    
    You can walk around on moving props as well.
    
    RUNNING
    
    While the dragon's walking speed is slow and precise, at a full sprint, dragons can outrun a cheetah (1)!
    Press [W] to increase the dragon's speed and keep it going. Again, [A] and [D] are used to steer.
    While running, the dragon's speed will slowly decay to walking speed if [W] is not pressed.
    
    Pressing [S] will cause the dragon to go into a slide for quick braking.
    
    Pressing [Space] will make the dragon jump into the air, and go into freefall. If you hold [Space], the dragon will spread its wings and fly.
    
    (1) A cheetah running at 72.7 Miles Per Hour
    
    FREEFALL
    
    While falling, the dragon's trajectory is pretty much ballistic. The only force acting on it will be gravity.
    
    Pressing [Space] while in freefall will cause the dragon to spread its wings and enter flight.
    
    FLIGHT
    
    Flight is the trickiest but most useful movement mode. Factors such as lift, drag, gravity, and thrust all play a part in how the dragon handles.
    
    Pressing [Space] will cause the dragon to flap its wings downward, providing extra lift. This is especially useful at low speeds.
    
    Pressing [Shift] will cause the dragon to flap its wings backwards, providing less lift, but more thrust. You can use this to gain more speed, but
    be careful not to stall at low speeds!
    
    Pressing [Alt] will cause the dragon to flap its wings forwards, reducing speed. Useful for when tight maneuvers are required.
    
    Pressing [V] will cause the dragon to stop flying and drop into freefall. This is useful for quick landings.
    
    [W] and [S] adjust the dragon's pitch (Up/Down tilt). Much like an airplane, [W] pitches downward and [S] pitches upwards.
    [A] and [D] are used to steer the dragon left and right.
    
    Some important things to consider when flying:
    *Crashing into obstacles (such as the skybox) has a noticeable impact (haha) on the dragon. He/She might look hurt for a moment, but don't worry,
    they'll shake it off!
    *The dragon can't hover. It can come really close, but if you're not flying forward, there isn't enough lift from flapping the wings to keep it from
    slowly descending.
    *Altitude can be exchanged for speed. If you need to speed up, pitch down and dive.
    *Turning sharply costs a lot of speed.
    
    SLIDING
    
    If you attempt to climb too steep of a slope, or if you need to brake in a hurry, the dragon will slide like Scooby-Doo, complete with cartoonish
    tire screeching noise.
    
    Pressing [W] while sliding will revert the dragon to a walk or run, depending on how fast you're sliding.
    Pressing [S] while sliding will slow you down a lot more.
    Pressing [Space] while sliding will cause the dragon to jump, just like if they were running.
    Not pressing anything will allow you to slide quite a long distance.
    
    SWIMMING
    
    Should you walk, run, or land in a sufficiently deep body of water, the dragon will swim on the surface, doing the doggie-paddle.
    The controls are identical to walking, except that [V] and [Shift] don't do anything.
    
    WEAPONS
    
    While riding on the dragon's back, you have at your disposal a number of "weapons." These include:
    
    *Fire Breath
    *Fire Balls
    *Prop Eating
    *Pickup/Drop
    *Button User
    *Follow
    
    To select your weapon, hold [Mouse 2] and use the scroll wheel to highlight the weapon of your choice.
    
    FIRE BREATH
    
    Press and hold [Mouse 1] to loose a steady stream of fire from the dragon's mouth. You can use this to set props and players (1) on fire!
    
    (1) Player and prop ignition may depend on prop protection and/or server settings.
    
    FIRE BALLS
    
    Press [Mouse 1] to spit a fast, explosive fireball in the direction you're looking. If you charge the fireball by holding [Mouse 1], the dragon will
    huff, puff, and blow out a much larger fireball that packs a much larger explosive punch.
    
    PROP EATING
    
    Point at a prop and press [Mouse 1], and the dragon will eat that prop if it is close and small enough. After you eat three props, the dragon will burp adorably!
    The dragon will not eat players, other dragons, or important parts of itself. Ragdolls, however, are not an issue, as long as you have prop protection.
    
    PICKUP/DROP
    
    Point at a prop and press [Mouse 1], and the dragon will pick up that prop with its mouth if it is close and small enough. Pressing [Mouse 1] again will make
    the dragon drop the item.
    
    BUTTON USER
    
    Point at a usable object (Door, Button, Etc.) and press [Mouse 1]. The dragon will reach out with its paw and use whatever you're pointing at. Great for throwing
    railroad switches or operating garage doors!
    
    FOLLOW
    
    Point at a prop or player and press [Mouse 1]. The dragon will follow that prop, player, or dragon in a manner similar to the .follow chat command. Point at the world and press
    [Mouse 1] to make the dragon stop following.
    
    CHAT COMMANDS
    
    The dragon has at its disposal a multitude of useful commands, accessible by the chat.
    
    All commands are one word and use the period as a control character. (Parenthetical) parameters are required, [Bracketed] paramters are optional.
    
    You can target specific dragons by putting part of the dragon's name right after the command, separated by a colon.
    For example, suppose you have two dragons, Alice and Bob. You want Alice to sit down, and you want Bob to teleport to [xXx]n00bSl4yer69[xXx].
    You could type,
    
    .sit:alice
    and
    .goto:bob n00b
    
    CHAT LOG
    
    The dragon has a chat log that, if left as default, will display in the player chat.
    This chat log is only visible to other players with dragons out, and displays whenever a dragon says something.
    
    If you don't like this chat log (it can take your attention away form the dragon itself or be annoying) you can disable it with the .talkprintmode command.
    If you want it always off, you can change the TalkPrintMode variable at the top of the Dragonscript E2.
    
    If you set the variable to 0, or toggle .talkprintmode, the chatlog will instead display in console.
    
    Additionally you can set a chatroom. By default, your chatroom is "all". using the .chatroom command, you can set it to any other chatroom.
    Setting it to another chatroom means only dragons in that chatroom can see eachothers chat log messages.
    
    Finally, there is a form of the chat log that is proximity based. If you have proximity mode, only dragons nearby will receive your messages.
    This goes for everyone else too, so if they're in proximity mode and you're not, you'll only see their messages if you're in their proximity.
    You can enable or disable this with the TalkProximityMode variable or with the .talkproximitymode command.
    
    ---
    
    .list
        The .list command prints a list of all useful chat commands to the chat.
    
    -----
    POSES
    -----
    
    .stand
        The .stand command makes the dragon stand up.
    
    .sit
        The .sit command makes the dragon sit down. It doesn't matter where the dragon is or what it's doing. When sitting, the dragon cannot move (except by teleporting).
    
    .lie [number posetype]
        The .lie command makes the dragon to down. When lying down, the dragon cannot move (except by teleporting).
        There are a number of pose options for this.
    
    .sleep
        The .sleep command makes the dragon fall asleep, complete with snoring and cartoon "ZZZ" effects. When asleep, the dragon can't move (except by teleporting) or do
        anything else but wake up.
    
    .wake
        The .wake command makes the dragon wake up, if asleep.
    
    --------
    MOBILITY
    --------
    
    .come
        The .come command makes the dragon teleport to wherever you are pointing. Great for if you get it stuck somewhere!
        Tip: if someone is driving the dragon around, the .come command may not work. Make it .sit first and then try!
    
    .goto (string name)
        The .goto command makes the dragon teleport to the specified player or dragon. Right behind them. Perfect for spooking people!
        Tip: see tip for .come command.
    
    .follow [string name]
        The .follow command makes the dragon follow the given target name. The dragon will walk and run to try and catch up to the target, and teleport if they get stuck.
        If no player name is given, the dragon will follow you.
        If no player name is given and the dragon is already following someone, the dragon will stop following.
        If no player name is given and you're pointing at a prop, the dragon will follow that prop instead.
    
    .cmere [string name]
        The .cmere command is the same as .follow, except it only works for players or dragons, and the dragon stops and greets the target when it gets close enough.
    
    .gohere
        The .gohere command makes the dragon walk to the coordinates you point at.
    
    .grab
        The .grab command makes the dragon ride whatever it's standing, sitting, or lying on. When riding a prop, the dragon will be unable to move.
    
    .release
        The .release command makes the dragon release from whichever prop it's riding.
    
    .crouch
        Toggles the dragon's crouching/climbing state.
        
    .allowrun [bool enable]
        Sets whether the dragon will run or walk when moving on its own.
    
    -------
    UTILITY
    -------
    
    .light
        The .light command toggles the dragon's handy lantern that it carries around in its mouth.
    
    .cam [number mode]
        The .cam command controls spectating the dragon first-person. Passing a parameter of 1 lets you see through the dragon's eyes, while a parameter of 0 (or nothing)
        returns you to your own view. A parameter of 2 enables the firstperson camera and makes the dragon look around as you do.
    
    .lookat [string name]
        The .lookat command makes the dragon look at a specific target, if specified.
        If no name is given, the dragon will revert to its normal looking-at behavior.
        If no name is given and you're pointing at a prop, the dragon will look at that prop.
    
    .pickup
        The .pickup command makes the dragon pick up whatever it's looking at, subject to the same restrictions as the pickup/drop weapon mode. If you're pointing at a prop,
        the dragon will attempt to pick that up instead.
    
    .drop
        The .drop command makes the dragon drop whatever is in its mouth.
    
    .eat
        The .eat command makes the dragon consider eating whatever it's looking at. If the dragon is carrying something in its mouth, it will eat that first.
        Pointing at a prop will make the dragon target that instead.
        Subject to the same restrictions as the prop eating weapon mode.
    
    .eject
        The .eject command kicks anyone who is riding the dragon off the dragon. Note: other players should only be able to do anything on your dragon if they have
        your prop protection, otherwise the dragon will kick them out of the driver's seat.
    
    .fire [number duration]
        The .fire command makes the dragon breathe fire at whatever or whomever it's looking at. Supplying the duration parameter changes how long the fire lasts.
    
    .headlock [number pitch] [number yaw] [number roll]
        The .headlock command forces the dragon to point its head to the specified 3D Angle. Pitches > 0 look upwards, Yaw > 0 looks left, Roll > 0 tilts left.
        This command is useful for when the dragon is riding a prop, so that it doesn't spaz its head when looking at nearby players.
        Alternatively, you can type '.headlock lock' or '.headlock copy' to lock into the current head angles, whatever they are.
        Typing .headlock without any arguments while the dragon is head-locked will allow it to look around freely again.
    
    .talkprintmode
        Toggles between the chat log appearing in the player chat box or the console.
    
    .talkproximitymode
        Toggles between the chat log being proximity based or global.
    
    .font [string fontname]
        Changes the font used by the speech bubble. The default is WireGPU_ConsoleFont. Acceptable fonts are: "WireGPU_ConsoleFont", "Coolvetica", "Arial", "Lucida Console", "Trebuchet",
        "Courier New", "Times New Roman", "ChatFont", "Marlett", and "Roboto". Not every font fits in the speech bubble, so be careful.
    
    .reset
        Reloads the E2.
    
    -----------
    PERSONALITY
    -----------
    
    .roar
        The .roar command makes the dragon roar. The exact sound it makes depends on what mood it's in (expression).
    
    .love [string expression]
        The .love command makes the dragon show their contentment or affection by roaring at you happily as hearts drift out of its head cartoonishly.
        Including an argument for the expression will make the dragon switch to that expression in the process.
    
    .expr [string expression] [bool eyelids] [bool squint]
        The .expr command changes the dragon's expression. The Expression paramter can be one of the following:
        
        normal
        happy
        sad
        grumpy
        annoyed
        angry
        confused
        smug
        concerned
        flustered
        scared
        worried
        
        A blank string reverts the dragon to normal (happy) expression.
        Putting a 1 for the Eyelids parameter makes the dragon's eyelids more prominent. This can have a significant effect on what the expression shows.
        For example, eyelids can be the difference between "F*** you" and "F*** me."
        
        Putting a 1 for the Squint parameter makes the dragon appear to be squinting. This can change an annoyed look into a suspicious one, amplify confusion, or make an expression look happier.
    
    .wink [number Eye]
        The .wink command causes the dragon to wink. Passing a zero forces it to stop winking. Passing a 1 makes the left eye wink, and 2 makes the right eye wink. If no
        parameter is given, it wil toggle between winking the left eye and not winking at all.
    
    .cry [bool Enable]
        Toggles tears at the corners of the dragon's eyes. Not emotion-dependent.
    
    .blush [bool Enable]
        Toggles a pink flushing effect in the dragon's cheeks. Not emption-dependent.
    
    .dance
        The .dance command toggles the dragon's dancing mode! While dancing, the dragon is unable to move (except by teleporting). Comes with music note effects.
    
    .say [string expression | name] "(string speech)"
    .say [string name] [string expression] \"(string speech)\"
        The .say command can be used to make the dragon talk! Note that the speech must be encased in quotes.
        
        Supplying an expression parameter will make the dragon's expression shift, incorporating the functionality of the .expr command.
        If you supply a name instead (it's determined automatically), it will instead talk to that target. This will be noted in the chatlog, and your dragon will 
        look at the target during the duration of the speech. You can also just put a name before the expression.
        
        If your chat log is displaying the player chat, supplying an expression will make the chat message flavored with an emotion.
        Supplying a target will also flavor the chat log.
        Examples:
        Grayscale angrily shouts! "Grr, I'm angry!"
        Grayscale says to Custard: "How are you doing?"
        
        You can also use a dragon autocomplete (it works on players too, actually).
        Putting the expression "d:[dragon/player]" will autocomplete that portion of their name, and also will color their name in the chat.
        This system works in .me and .event as well.
        Examples with a dragon named "Zenith Leadwing":
        Command: .say "Hello, d:zen" | Output: Grayscale says: "Hello, Zenith" (The "Zenith" portion will be colored)
        Command: .say "Hello, d:lead" | Output: Grayscale says "Hello, Leadwing" (Still colored)
    
    .sayto (string name) [string expression] \"(string speech)\"
    .talkto (string name) [string expression] \"(string speech)\"
        Also makes the dragon target, but at a specific target. Works like the previous .say supplied with a target, but is more rigid and requires a name.
    
    .chatroom [string chatroom]
        Sets the current chat log chatroom. By default, this is set to "all".
        If you leave the command blank, it will default it back to "all".
    
    .me
        Makes your dragon "say" they performed an action. It will show up in chat, and in a square speech bubble.
        Supports dragon autocomplete (d:)
        Examples:
        .me waves to you | Grayscale waves to you
        .me is very happy | Grayscale is very happy
    
    .event
        Only works with the chat log visible. Performs an "event" visible to everyone in the chatlog.
        Supports dragon autocomplete (d:)
        Examples:
        .event A huge explosion sounds in the distance!
        .event The earth shakes, making d:grayscale fall over!
    
    .blep [number Angle]
        Causes the dragon to stick their tongue out at the specified angle, or toggle on/off if no number is given.
    
    .mlem [bool Loop]
    .kiss [bool Loop]
    .lick [bool Loop]
        Causes the dragon to doggie-kiss whatever it is looking at. If a 1 is given, the dragon will repeatedly lick until told to stop.
    
    .burp
        The .burp command forces the dragon to belch. It does not say "Excuse me" unless told to.
    
    .closeeyes
        The .closeeyes command opens or closes the dragon's eyes.
    
    .eyeroll [bool Groan]
    .rolleyes [bool Groan]
        Make the dragon roll their eyes sarcastically. If provided an argument of 1, the dragon will also groan.
    
    .groan
        Make the dragon groan in disgust.
    
    .yes
    .nod
        Make the dragon nod their head 'yes'.
    
    .no
    .headshake
        Make the dragon shake their head 'no'.
    
    --------------
    DEBUG COMMANDS
    --------------
    
    A couple of commands that aren't really useful, but made for testing and left in.
    
    .splat [number duration]
        The .splat command stuns the dragon momentarily and makes it flop on the ground for no apparent reason.
        If a number is provided, the dragon will be stunned for that many seconds.
        If the number is 0, the dragon will be stunned indefinitely until you use the .recover command.
    
    .recover
        Makes the dragon recover from the stunned state (.splat).
    
    .jaw [number angle]
        The .jaw command makes the dragon open its mouth to the specified angle in degrees. Clamped from 0 to 30.
    
    .posewings (string option) [numbers values]
        Allows you to control the wing base pose. Since there are five variables you can adjust, the command allows you to change them one at a time.
    
        The options are:
        
        "yaw" : Changes/Resets the Forward Yaw. Positive values rotate the wings forward. The wings are rotated this way FIRST.
        "pitch" : Changes/Resets the Angle of Attack (AoA) Pitch. Positive values increase the AoA. The wings are rotated this way SECOND.
        "roll" : Changes/Resets the Upward Roll. Positive values roll the wings up towards the vertical. The wings are rotated this way THIRD.
        "splay" : The angle between the wing ribs. Changing this value can give the effect of stretching/extending the wings out.
        "flap" : The 'flap factor', a value from -1 to +1 that bends the wings up (+1) or down (-1).
        "get" : Prints all the current values, and command to restore them, to the chat.
        "all" : Allows you to set all five parameters at once, in the order Pitch, Yaw, Roll, Splay, Flap.
    
    .poseneck [number pitch]
        Poses the dragon's neck from 0 to 45 degrees (default 30).

    The Northern Dragon (Scientific name Draco Borealis) is a quadrupedal winged creature native to parts of North America and Europe. Known since
    ancient times as evil, even demonic bringers of fire and destruction, Dragons are actually friendly and adorable bringers of fire and destruction.
    Because there is so much misunderstanding and stigma surrounding these beautiful creatures, we've assembled this FAQ list to help dispel misinformation
    and increase public awareness.
    
    Q: What do dragons eat?
    A: Dragons primarily subsist on radioactive minerals and materials in the Earth's crust. They also eat metals when available, as many organs in the dragon's body
    require them. They are perfectly capable of digesting 'traditional' food, however, and sometimes eat human food for the taste.
    Warning: Dragons have a high sensitivity to capsaicin (the chemical responsible for spicy foods) and ingesting even small amounts of it will cause them
    great pain and discomfort.
    
    Q: Dragons eat radioactive materials? Am I in danger from radiation exposure?
    A: Of course not! Dragon skin is incredibly thick and is an excellent radiation reflector. This is only efficient, as it prevents radioactive losses to the environment.
    
    Q: How do dragons go to the bathroom?
    A: They use a toilet. A fireproof one, but similar to what humans use. It's also lower to the floor, usually.
    
    Q: Where do dragons live?
    A: Dragons historically lived underground, in caves and caverns. In modern times, this is still largely true, but many dragons have moved to the surface in order to
    seek work or for other reasons.
    
    Q: Are dragons reptiles?
    A: Nope! That's a common misconception; they are mammals! They have hair (visible as eyelashes), mammary glands (fortunately not visible), and are warm-blooded.
    
    Q: How do dragons breathe fire?
    A: The fire is actually produced by igniting a highly flammable mucous produced in the dragon's sinuses. They effectively sneeze napalm!
    
    Q: Do dragons like music?
    A: Many of them do. Their tastes are usually for the classics, but dragons will dance to just about anything!
    
    Q: How do dragons just stick to stuff like that?
    A: Magnets.
