@name dragonscript/init

#This E2 does two important things.
#One, it stores the @persist lines for the entire main chip, which as you can see is a helluva lot.
#Two, it initializes every single variable you're supposed to be able to edit in a config. Every variable set here will have a description for what it does.
#DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE.
#Instead, set the appropriate values in the config if you want to change them. No @persist-ing will be necessary.
