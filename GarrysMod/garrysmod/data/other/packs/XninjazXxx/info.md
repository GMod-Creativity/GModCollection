Well, it's been a while since I've posted anything here. I've completely forgot about wiremod until someone contacted me with telling that someone was abusing my stuff. Since I'm probably never going to pick up gmod again, I might as well post every single E2 I have (know that some of them are very old). Just a final note, some of them aren't finished and don't work. This is my entire "original" folder of E2s so be warned!
Just another note: It's going to be significantly harder to use my _#Pseudoadmin E2 as I've deleted all the predefined variables and added a bunch of anti-dupe protection all throughout the entire code.

To install them, you need to extract the contents of the .zip file to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\d ata\expression2"

If you don't have a "Program Files (x86)" then navigate to "Program Files".

If you use a mac, the directory is "~/Library/Application Support/Steam\SteamApps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\ex pression2"
