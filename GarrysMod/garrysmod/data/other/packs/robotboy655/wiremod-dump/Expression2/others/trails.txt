#Now for our color, this will be in the form of a Vector
#Your first value will be Red, use range from 0 to 255
#Your second value will be Green, use range from 0 to 255
#Your third value will be Blue, use range from 0 to 255

#Alpha uses 0 to 255 range as well, 255 being solid visible

#This statement sets the application of the trail to the entity
#-that the player is aiming at.  So wire 'Set' to a 'Numpad_Input'
#-with the values set to 'OFF=0' and 'ON=1'
#When you hit Set the entity will have a trail attached to it
