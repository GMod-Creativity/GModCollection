- Title: [E2] Fully functional Hexapod walker.

## [E2] Fully functional Hexapod walker

Hey guys, figured I'd share this 'cause well, hexapods are cool and I've already written an article about it.

It's all controlled by a single chip translating the sequences into workable hydraulic patterns depending on the function. E.g. single legs, pairs of legs, or groups of 3. It moves quite naturally too =)

Anyhoo, I hope you don't mind external links, but it makes sense to have the download in one place with the build instructions:

Enjoy =)
