## [Gmod] Pac3 Madeon's Shelter {Download} {Final}

PLEASE READ THE DESCRIPTION BELOW

First, let's start off with a disclaimer.

I do not own the song, and this creation is a parody on on Madeon and Porter Robinson's Shelter animation, which can be found here:

As for the outfits, I will not be continuing them for a long time. This does not mean permanently, however it is unlikely I will upload in the next month or so.

This outfit's events are not automated, and require keybinds for the pac to function. The music is triggered by the key [P], and should be held for the duration of the outfit. [7] controls the beginning stage, [8] controls the crimson sky stage, [9] controls the paradise stage, and [0] controls the starry night stage. Quickly exchange pressing from [7] to [8] to allow fluid transitioning, as you should with every switch (such as [8] to [9], [0] to [9], etc). This will allow users to create their own custom mix. Also, it saves a ton of file space. Speaking of file space, this is the largest pac I have created, at around 170 KB.

And to prevent copying of this pac, here's my steam profile: https://steamcommunity.com/id/bricksiceweeb. Don't worry, everything you see there is an ironic meme. Also my playtime. Pretty sad. Anyway, don't let anyone copy my GRAND FINALE n other pacs.
