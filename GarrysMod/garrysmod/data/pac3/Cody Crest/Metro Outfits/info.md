I do not own any of the music presented in this video

Here's 3 mini-pacs since I ran out of music to make cooler pacs.
These outfits were originally used for myself in the Metro RP gamemode, since I had a blast using pac3 in an actual roleplay server. But, now that the players have to PAY to use pac3, I might as well release them all since I'm not returning to the server.

Metro Guitar
Note: You will have to set binds for this. It will consume about 3 keys. I've also added a guitar pick to the download version of this outfit.
bind key1 "pac_event soldat 2; pac_event guitar 2"
bind key2 "pac_event thunder 2; pac_event guitar 2"
bind key3 "pac_event acoustic 2; pac_event guitar 2"
