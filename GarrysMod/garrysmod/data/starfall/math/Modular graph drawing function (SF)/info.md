- Title: Modular graph drawing function

## Modular graph drawing function

If you want to graph math functions or game data, this is for you.

Description: Input the size, position, titles, axis labels, colours and data, and it draws you a graph.

Special features: Axis scale properly for negatives in either axis, and will scale the minimum and maximum values to nice round numbers and draw gridlines.

The code includes inline examples at the bottom, which produce what you see in the screen shot. Because of the function's modular nature, it can be incorporated into your code very easily.
